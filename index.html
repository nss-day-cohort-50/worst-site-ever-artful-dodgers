            <p>Literally the best mug in the entire universe. All liquids poured into this mug turn into liquid
                gold, but at a drinkable temperature. Scientists will argue that this isn't possible, but have 
                they even tried drinking from this mug? No. No they haven't. So don't be a scientist.</p>
